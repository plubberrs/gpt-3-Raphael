A generative chatbot created as a part of my Machine Learning exploratory project. I use the famous GPT-3 (Generative Pretrained Transformer version 3) for the text generation ML model, which I got from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). The chatbot is connected to [Discord API](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/212889058-Discord-s-Official-API), and that's actually the only part that I do the work myself. Even the setup for the discord bot, I pretty much learnt and took a lot of codes from [this YouTube series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW3GfRiBCHOhfVoiDZpSz8SM_HybXRPzZ) by [Lucas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR-zOCvDCayyYy1flR5qaAg). This bot is strictly for my personal use, and the credit goes to OpenAI for their amazing GPT-3 API.
