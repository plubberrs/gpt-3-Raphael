A generative chatbot created as a part of my Machine Learning exploratory project. I uses the famous GPT-3 (Generative Pretrained Transformer version 3) for the text generation ML model, which I got from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). The chatbot is connected to [Discord API](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/212889058-Discord-s-Official-API), and that's actually the only part that I do the work myself. This bot is strictly for my personal use, and the credit goes to OpenAI for their amazing GPT-3 API.
